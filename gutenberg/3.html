<h2> <b>ACT I</b></h2>
<h3> <b>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Antonio, Salarino</span> and
<span class="charname">Solanio</span>.</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
In sooth I know not why I am so sad,<br>
It wearies me. you say it wearies you;<br>
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br>
What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,<br>
I am to learn.<br>
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br>
That I have much ado to know myself.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Your mind is tossing on the ocean,<br>
There where your argosies, with portly sail<br>
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br>
Or as it were the pageants of the sea,<br>
Do overpeer the petty traffickers<br>
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br>
As they fly by them with their woven wings.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br>
The better part of my affections would<br>
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br>
Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,<br>
Peering in maps for ports, and piers and roads;<br>
And every object that might make me fear<br>
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br>
Would make me sad.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
My wind cooling my broth<br>
Would blow me to an ague when I thought<br>
What harm a wind too great might do at sea.<br>
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run<br>
But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br>
And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,<br>
Vailing her high top lower than her ribs<br>
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>
And see the holy edifice of stone<br>
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>
Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,<br>
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>
And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br>
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>
That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?<br>
But tell not me, I know Antonio<br>
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,<br>
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br>
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br>
Upon the fortune of this present year.<br>
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Why then you are in love.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Fie, fie!
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad<br>
Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy<br>
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry<br>
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,<br>
Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:<br>
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,<br>
And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper.<br>
And other of such vinegar aspect<br>
That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile<br>
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Bassanio, Lorenzo</span> and
<span class="charname">Gratiano</span>.</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<br>
Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well.<br>
We leave you now with better company.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,<br>
If worthier friends had not prevented me.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Your worth is very dear in my regard.<br>
I take it your own business calls on you,<br>
And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Good morrow, my good lords.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?<br>
You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Salarino</span> and
<span class="charname">Solanio</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,<br>
We two will leave you, but at dinner-time<br>
I pray you have in mind where we must meet.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
I will not fail you.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
You look not well, Signior Antonio,<br>
You have too much respect upon the world.<br>
They lose it that do buy it with much care.<br>
Believe me, you are marvellously chang’d.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,<br>
A stage, where every man must play a part,<br>
And mine a sad one.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Let me play the fool,<br>
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<br>
And let my liver rather heat with wine<br>
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br>
Why should a man whose blood is warm within<br>
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?<br>
Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundice<br>
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,<br>
(I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks):<br>
There are a sort of men whose visages<br>
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<br>
And do a wilful stillness entertain,<br>
With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion<br>
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<br>
As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,<br>
And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”<br>
O my Antonio, I do know of these<br>
That therefore only are reputed wise<br>
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<br>
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears<br>
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br>
I’ll tell thee more of this another time.<br>
But fish not with this melancholy bait<br>
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br>
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while.<br>
I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.<br>
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<br>
For Gratiano never lets me speak.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Well, keep me company but two years moe,<br>
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Fare you well. I’ll grow a talker for this gear.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable<br>
In a neat’s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Gratiano</span> and
<span class="charname">Lorenzo</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Is that anything now?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.
His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you shall
seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them they are not worth the
search.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Well, tell me now what lady is the same<br>
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<br>
That you today promis’d to tell me of?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br>
How much I have disabled mine estate<br>
By something showing a more swelling port<br>
Than my faint means would grant continuance.<br>
Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d<br>
From such a noble rate, but my chief care<br>
Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br>
Wherein my time, something too prodigal,<br>
Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,<br>
I owe the most in money and in love,<br>
And from your love I have a warranty<br>
To unburden all my plots and purposes<br>
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br>
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br>
Within the eye of honour, be assur’d<br>
My purse, my person, my extremest means<br>
Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<br>
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br>
The self-same way, with more advised watch<br>
To find the other forth; and by adventuring both<br>
I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof<br>
Because what follows is pure innocence.<br>
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,<br>
That which I owe is lost. But if you please<br>
To shoot another arrow that self way<br>
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>
As I will watch the aim, or to find both,<br>
Or bring your latter hazard back again,<br>
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>
To wind about my love with circumstance;<br>
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br>
In making question of my uttermost<br>
Than if you had made waste of all I have.<br>
Then do but say to me what I should do<br>
That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>
And I am prest unto it. Therefore, speak.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
In Belmont is a lady richly left,<br>
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br>
Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes<br>
I did receive fair speechless messages:<br>
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d<br>
To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.<br>
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>
For the four winds blow in from every coast<br>
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<br>
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,<br>
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strond,<br>
And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br>
O my Antonio, had I but the means<br>
To hold a rival place with one of them,<br>
I have a mind presages me such thrift<br>
That I should questionless be fortunate.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;<br>
Neither have I money nor commodity<br>
To raise a present sum, therefore go forth<br>
Try what my credit can in Venice do;<br>
That shall be rack’d even to the uttermost,<br>
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.<br>
Go presently inquire, and so will I,<br>
Where money is, and I no question make<br>
To have it of my trust or for my sake.

<h3> <b>SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Portia</span> with her
waiting-woman <span class="charname">Nerissa</span>.</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great world.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your
good fortunes are. And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with
too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore,
to be seated in the mean. Superfluity come sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Good sentences, and well pronounc’d.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
They would be better if well followed.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been
churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good
divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were
good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The
brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold
decree; such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good
counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a
husband. O me, the word “choose”! I may neither choose who I would
nor refuse who I dislike, so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by
the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one,
nor refuse none?
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good
inspirations. Therefore the lott’ry that he hath devised in these three
chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you,
will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly
love. But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely
suitors that are already come?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them, and
according to my description level at my affection.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and
he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him
himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Then is there the County Palatine.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say “And you will not have me,
choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. I fear he will prove the
weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in
his youth. I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his
mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a
sin to be a mocker, but he! why, he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine. He
is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring.
He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty
husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to
madness, I shall never requite him.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him: he hath
neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear
that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s
picture; but alas, who can converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I
think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in
Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he borrowed a box of the ear of
the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the
Frenchman became his surety, and seal’d under for another.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Very vilely in the morning when he is sober, and most vilely in the afternoon
when he is drunk: when he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he
is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell,
I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to
perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept him.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine
on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within and that temptation without,
I know he will choose it. I will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to
a sponge.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me
with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to
trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than
your father’s imposition, depending on the caskets.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be
obtained by the manner of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of
wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his
very absence. And I pray God grant them a fair departure.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian,
a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of
Montferrat?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
True, madam. He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon,
was the best deserving a fair lady.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a <span class="charname">Servingman</span>.</p>
<p>How now! what news?
</p>
<p>SERVINGMAN.<br>
The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave. And there is a
forerunner come from a fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince
his master will be here tonight.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four
farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint
and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.
Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,
another knocks at the door.

<h3> <b>SCENE III. Venice. A public place.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Bassanio</span> with
<span class="charname">Shylock</span> the Jew.</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Three thousand ducats, well.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Ay, sir, for three months.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
For three months, well.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Antonio shall become bound, well.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Your answer to that.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Antonio is a good man.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Ho, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you
understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath
an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,
upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other
ventures he hath squandered abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men;
there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves—I mean
pirates—and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man
is, notwithstanding, sufficient. Three thousand ducats. I think I may take his
bond.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Be assured you may.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I will be assured I may. And that I may be assured, I will bethink me. May I
speak with Antonio?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
If it please you to dine with us.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,
conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you,
nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Antonio</span>.</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
This is Signior Antonio.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
[<i>Aside.</i>] How like a fawning publican he looks!<br>
I hate him for he is a Christian,<br>
But more for that in low simplicity<br>
He lends out money gratis, and brings down<br>
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.<br>
If I can catch him once upon the hip,<br>
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.<br>
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,<br>
Even there where merchants most do congregate,<br>
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,<br>
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe<br>
If I forgive him!
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Shylock, do you hear?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I am debating of my present store,<br>
And by the near guess of my memory<br>
I cannot instantly raise up the gross<br>
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?<br>
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,<br>
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months<br>
Do you desire? [<i>To Antonio.</i>] Rest you fair, good signior,<br>
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow<br>
By taking nor by giving of excess,<br>
Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br>
I’ll break a custom. [<i>To Bassanio.</i>] Is he yet possess’d<br>
How much ye would?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
And for three months.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I had forgot, three months, you told me so.<br>
Well then, your bond. And let me see, but hear you,<br>
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow<br>
Upon advantage.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I do never use it.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
When Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep,—<br>
This Jacob from our holy Abram was<br>
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,<br>
The third possessor; ay, he was the third.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
And what of him? Did he take interest?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
No, not take interest, not, as you would say,<br>
Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.<br>
When Laban and himself were compromis’d<br>
That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied<br>
Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank<br>
In end of autumn turned to the rams,<br>
And when the work of generation was<br>
Between these woolly breeders in the act,<br>
The skilful shepherd pill’d me certain wands,<br>
And in the doing of the deed of kind,<br>
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,<br>
Who then conceiving did in eaning time<br>
Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s.<br>
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;<br>
And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for,<br>
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,<br>
But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.<br>
Was this inserted to make interest good?<br>
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.<br>
But note me, signior.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Mark you this, Bassanio,<br>
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.<br>
An evil soul producing holy witness<br>
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<br>
A goodly apple rotten at the heart.<br>
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum.<br>
Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br>
In the Rialto you have rated me<br>
About my moneys and my usances.<br>
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,<br>
(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.)<br>
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,<br>
And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,<br>
And all for use of that which is mine own.<br>
Well then, it now appears you need my help.<br>
Go to, then, you come to me, and you say<br>
“Shylock, we would have moneys.” You say so:<br>
You that did void your rheum upon my beard,<br>
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur<br>
Over your threshold, moneys is your suit.<br>
What should I say to you? Should I not say<br>
“Hath a dog money? Is it possible<br>
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or<br>
Shall I bend low and, in a bondman’s key,<br>
With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,<br>
Say this:<br>
“Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last;<br>
You spurn’d me such a day; another time<br>
You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies<br>
I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I am as like to call thee so again,<br>
To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.<br>
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br>
As to thy friends, for when did friendship take<br>
A breed for barren metal of his friend?<br>
But lend it rather to thine enemy,<br>
Who if he break, thou mayst with better face<br>
Exact the penalty.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Why, look you how you storm!<br>
I would be friends with you, and have your love,<br>
Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with,<br>
Supply your present wants, and take no doit<br>
Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me,<br>
This is kind I offer.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
This were kindness.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
This kindness will I show.<br>
Go with me to a notary, seal me there<br>
Your single bond; and in a merry sport,<br>
If you repay me not on such a day,<br>
In such a place, such sum or sums as are<br>
Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit<br>
Be nominated for an equal pound<br>
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken<br>
In what part of your body pleaseth me.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond,<br>
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
You shall not seal to such a bond for me,<br>
I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it,<br>
Within these two months, that’s a month before<br>
This bond expires, I do expect return<br>
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
O father Abram, what these Christians are,<br>
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect<br>
The thoughts of others. Pray you, tell me this,<br>
If he should break his day, what should I gain<br>
By the exaction of the forfeiture?<br>
A pound of man’s flesh, taken from a man,<br>
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,<br>
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,<br>
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship.<br>
If he will take it, so. If not, adieu,<br>
And for my love I pray you wrong me not.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s,<br>
Give him direction for this merry bond,<br>
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,<br>
See to my house left in the fearful guard<br>
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently<br>
I’ll be with you.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Hie thee, gentle Jew.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Shylock</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Come on; in this there can be no dismay;<br>
My ships come home a month before the day.

<h2> <b>ACT II</b></h2>
<h3> <b>SCENE I. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Flourish of cornets. Enter the <span class="charname">Prince
of Morocco</span>, a tawny Moor all in white, and three or four followers accordingly,
with <span class="charname">Portia, Nerissa</span> and their train.</p>
<p>PRINCE OF MOROCCO.<br>
Mislike me not for my complexion,<br>
The shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun,<br>
To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.<br>
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,<br>
Where Phœbus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,<br>
And let us make incision for your love<br>
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.<br>
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine<br>
Hath fear’d the valiant; by my love I swear<br>
The best-regarded virgins of our clime<br>
Have lov’d it too. I would not change this hue,<br>
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
In terms of choice I am not solely led<br>
By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes;<br>
Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny<br>
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.<br>
But if my father had not scanted me<br>
And hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself<br>
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,<br>
Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair<br>
As any comer I have look’d on yet<br>
For my affection.
</p>
<p>PRINCE OF MOROCCO.<br>
Even for that I thank you.<br>
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets<br>
To try my fortune. By this scimitar<br>
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,<br>
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,<br>
I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,<br>
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,<br>
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,<br>
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,<br>
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!<br>
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice<br>
Which is the better man, the greater throw<br>
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:<br>
So is Alcides beaten by his rage,<br>
And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,<br>
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,<br>
And die with grieving.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You must take your chance,<br>
And either not attempt to choose at all,<br>
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong<br>
Never to speak to lady afterward<br>
In way of marriage. Therefore be advis’d.
</p>
<p>PRINCE OF MOROCCO.<br>
Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
First, forward to the temple. After dinner<br>
Your hazard shall be made.

<h3> <b>SCENE II. Venice. A street.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Launcelet Gobbo</span>, the
clown, alone.</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. The fiend
is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me “Gobbo, Launcelet Gobbo,
good Launcelet” or “good Gobbo,” or “good Launcelet
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says
“No; take heed, honest Launcelet, take heed, honest Gobbo” or, as
aforesaid, “honest Launcelet Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy
heels.” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!”
says the fiend, “away!” says the fiend. “For the heavens,
rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend “and run.” Well, my
conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me
“My honest friend Launcelet, being an honest man’s
son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father
did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste;—well, my
conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.” “Budge,” says
the fiend. “Budge not,” says my conscience.
“Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.”
“Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be ruled by my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who, (God bless the mark) is
a kind of devil; and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the fiend,
who (saving your reverence) is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very
devil incarnation, and, in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard
conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the
more friendly counsel. I will run, fiend, my heels are at your commandment, I
will run.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Old Gobbo</span> with a basket.</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew’s?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
[<i>Aside.</i>] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father, who being more than
sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not. I will try confusions with him.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but at the next turning of
all on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
down indirectly to the Jew’s house.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Be God’s sonties, ’twill be a hard way to hit. Can you
tell me whether one Launcelet, that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Talk you of young Master Launcelet? [<i>Aside.</i>] Mark me now, now will I
raise the waters. Talk you of young Master Launcelet?
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
No master, sir, but a poor man’s son, his father, though I
say’t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked, well to
live.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Well, let his father be what he will, we talk of young Master Launcelet.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Your worship’s friend, and Launcelet, sir.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
But I pray you, <i>ergo</i>, old man, <i>ergo</i>, I beseech you, talk you of
young Master Launcelet?
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Of Launcelet, an’t please your mastership.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
<i>Ergo</i>, Master Launcelet. Talk not of Master Launcelet, father, for the
young gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies, and such odd sayings, the
Sisters Three and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you
would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or a prop? Do
you know me, father?
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Alack the day! I know you not, young gentleman, but I pray you tell me, is my
boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Do you not know me, father?
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me: it is a
wise father that knows his own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
your son. Give me your blessing, truth will come to light, murder cannot be hid
long, a man’s son may, but in the end truth will out.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Pray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing.
I am Launcelet, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
I cannot think you are my son.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
I know not what I shall think of that; but I am Launcelet, the Jew’s man,
and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Her name is Margery, indeed. I’ll be sworn if thou be Launcelet, thou
art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipped might he be, what a beard hast
thou got! Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on
his tail.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward. I am sure he had
more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy master agree? I
have brought him a present. How ’gree you now?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Well, well. But for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I
will not rest till I have run some ground. My master’s a very Jew. Give
him a present! Give him a halter. I am famished in his service. You may tell
every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come, give me your
present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries. If I serve
not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O rare fortune, here comes
the man! To him, father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Bassanio</span> with
<span class="charname">Leonardo</span> and a follower or two.</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
You may do so, but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by
five of the clock. See these letters delivered, put the liveries to making, and
desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit a <span class="charname">Servant</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
To him, father.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
God bless your worship!
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew’s man, that would, sir, as my
father shall specify.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew, and have a desire, as my
father shall specify.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
His master and he (saving your worship’s reverence) are scarce
cater-cousins.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having done me wrong, doth cause
me, as my father, being I hope an old man, shall frutify unto you.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship,
and my suit is—
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as your worship shall know by
this honest old man, and though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my
father.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
One speak for both. What would you?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Serve you, sir.
</p>
<p>GOBBO.<br>
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
I know thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit.<br>
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,<br>
And hath preferr’d thee, if it be preferment<br>
To leave a rich Jew’s service to become<br>
The follower of so poor a gentleman.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you, sir: you
have “the grace of God”, sir, and he hath “enough”.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Thou speak’st it well. Go, father, with thy son.<br>
Take leave of thy old master, and inquire<br>
My lodging out. [<i>To a Servant.</i>] Give him a livery<br>
More guarded than his fellows’; see it done.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne’er a tongue in my head!
[<i>Looking on his palm.</i>] Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table
which doth offer to swear upon a book, I shall have good fortune; go to,
here’s a simple line of life. Here’s a small trifle of wives, alas,
fifteen wives is nothing; eleven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in

Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice,<br>

Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain<br>

Go, draw aside the curtains and discover<br>
The several caskets to this noble prince.<br>
Now make your choice.
</p>
<p>PRINCE OF MOROCCO.<br>
The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,<br>
“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”<br>
The second, silver, which this promise carries,<br>
“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”<br>
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,<br>
“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”<br>
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
The one of them contains my picture, prince.<br>
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
</p>
<p>PRINCE OF MOROCCO.<br>
Some god direct my judgment! Let me see.<br>
I will survey the inscriptions back again.<br>
What says this leaden casket?<br>
“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”<br>
Must give, for what? For lead? Hazard for lead!<br>
This casket threatens; men that hazard all<br>
Do it in hope of fair advantages:<br>
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross,<br>
I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.<br>
What says the silver with her virgin hue?<br>
“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”<br>
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,<br>
And weigh thy value with an even hand.<br>
If thou be’st rated by thy estimation<br>
Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough<br>
May not extend so far as to the lady.<br>
And yet to be afeard of my deserving<br>
Were but a weak disabling of myself.<br>
As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady:<br>
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,<br>
In graces, and in qualities of breeding;<br>
But more than these, in love I do deserve.<br>
What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here?<br>
Let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold:<br>
“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”<br>
Why, that’s the lady, all the world desires her.<br>
From the four corners of the earth they come<br>
To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.<br>
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds<br>
Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now<br>
For princes to come view fair Portia.<br>
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head<br>
Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar<br>
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come<br>
As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.<br>
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.<br>
Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation<br>
To think so base a thought. It were too gross<br>
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.<br>
Or shall I think in silver she’s immur’d<br>
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?<br>
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem<br>
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England<br>
A coin that bears the figure of an angel<br>
Stamped in gold; but that’s insculp’d upon;<br>
But here an angel in a golden bed<br>
Lies all within. Deliver me the key.<br>
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.

Then I am yours.

With him is Gratiano gone along;<br>
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
The villain Jew with outcries rais’d the Duke,<br>
Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
He came too late, the ship was under sail;<br>
But there the Duke was given to understand<br>
That in a gondola were seen together<br>
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.<br>
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke<br>
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
I never heard a passion so confus’d,<br>
So strange, outrageous, and so variable<br>
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.<br>
“My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!<br>
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!<br>
Justice! the law! my ducats and my daughter!<br>
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,<br>
Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!<br>
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,<br>
Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! find the girl,<br>
She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.”
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,<br>
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Let good Antonio look he keep his day<br>
Or he shall pay for this.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Marry, well rememb’red.<br>
I reason’d with a Frenchman yesterday,<br>
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part<br>
The French and English, there miscarried<br>
A vessel of our country richly fraught.<br>
I thought upon Antonio when he told me,<br>
And wish’d in silence that it were not his.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,<br>
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.<br>
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part,<br>
Bassanio told him he would make some speed<br>
Of his return. He answered “Do not so,<br>
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,<br>
But stay the very riping of the time,<br>
And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,<br>
Let it not enter in your mind of love:<br>
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts<br>
To courtship, and such fair ostents of love<br>
As shall conveniently become you there.”<br>
And even there, his eye being big with tears,<br>
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,<br>
And with affection wondrous sensible<br>
He wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
I think he only loves the world for him.<br>
I pray thee, let us go and find him out<br>
And quicken his embraced heaviness<br>
With some delight or other.

What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see:<br>
“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”<br>
What many men desire! that “many” may be meant<br>
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,<br>
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,<br>
Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet<br>
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,<br>
Even in the force and road of casualty.<br>
I will not choose what many men desire,<br>
Because I will not jump with common spirits<br>
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.<br>
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house,<br>
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.<br>
“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”<br>
And well said too; for who shall go about<br>
To cozen fortune, and be honourable<br>
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume<br>
To wear an undeserved dignity.<br>
O that estates, degrees, and offices<br>
Were not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honour<br>
Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer!<br>
How many then should cover that stand bare?<br>
How many be commanded that command?<br>
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned<br>
From the true seed of honour? And how much honour<br>
Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times,<br>
To be new varnish’d? Well, but to my choice.<br>
“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”<br>
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,<br>
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.<br>
How much unlike art thou to Portia!<br>
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!<br>

<h2> <b>ACT III</b></h2>
<h3> <b>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Solanio</span> and
<span class="charname">Salarino</span>.</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Now, what news on the Rialto?
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Why, yet it lives there unchecked that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading
wrack’d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think they call the place, a
very dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie
buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her
neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true,
without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the
good Antonio, the honest Antonio,—O that I had a title good enough to
keep his name company!—
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Come, the full stop.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
I would it might prove the end of his losses.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Let me say “amen” betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for here
he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Shylock</span>.</p>
<p>
How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
That’s certain, I, for my part, knew the tailor that made the wings she
flew withal.
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged; and then it is the
complexion of them all to leave the dam.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
She is damn’d for it.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
My own flesh and blood to rebel!
</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory,
more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell
us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
There I have another bad match, a bankrupt, a prodigal, who dare scarce show
his head on the Rialto, a beggar that used to come so smug upon the mart; let
him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond:
he was wont to lend money for a Christian cur’sy; let him look to his
bond.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh! What’s that
good for?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He
hath disgrac’d me and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d at
my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies. And what’s his reason? I am a
Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses,
affections, passions? Fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,
subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by
the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not
bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And
if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian
example? Why, revenge! The villainy you teach me I will execute, and it shall
go hard but I will better the instruction.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a man from Antonio.</p>
<p>SERVANT.<br>
Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires to speak with you
both.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
We have been up and down to seek him.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Tubal</span>.</p>
<p>SOLANIO.<br>
Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be match’d, unless the
devil himself turn Jew.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Solanio, Salarino</span>

<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found my daughter?
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in
Frankfort! The curse never fell upon our nation till now, I never felt it till
now. Two thousand ducats in that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would
my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she were
hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin. No news of them? Why so? And
I know not what’s spent in the search. Why, thou—loss upon loss!
The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief, and no
satisfaction, no revenge, nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o’ my
shoulders, no sighs but o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my
shedding.
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
Yes, other men have ill luck too. Antonio, as I heard in Genoa—
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
—hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I thank God! I thank God! Is it true, is it true?
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news! Ha, ha, heard in Genoa?
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Thou stick’st a dagger in me. I shall never see my gold again. Fourscore
ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that
swear he cannot choose but break.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am glad
of it.
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turquoise, I had it of Leah
when I was a bachelor. I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
</p>
<p>TUBAL.<br>
But Antonio is certainly undone.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer;
bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit,
for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and
meet me at our synagogue. Go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.

<h3> <b>SCENE II. Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano,
Nerissa</span> and all their trains.</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I pray you tarry, pause a day or two<br>
Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong<br>
I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.<br>
There’s something tells me (but it is not love)<br>
I would not lose you, and you know yourself<br>
Hate counsels not in such a quality.<br>
But lest you should not understand me well,—<br>
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,—<br>
I would detain you here some month or two<br>
Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br>
How to choose right, but then I am forsworn.<br>
So will I never be. So may you miss me.<br>
But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,<br>
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br>
They have o’erlook’d me and divided me.<br>
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<br>
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,<br>
And so all yours. O these naughty times<br>
Puts bars between the owners and their rights!<br>
And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br>
Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br>
I speak too long, but ’tis to peise the time,<br>
To eche it, and to draw it out in length,<br>
To stay you from election.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Let me choose,<br>
For as I am, I live upon the rack.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess<br>
What treason there is mingled with your love.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
None but that ugly treason of mistrust,<br>
Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love.<br>
There may as well be amity and life<br>
’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack<br>
Where men enforced do speak anything.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Well then, confess and live.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
“Confess and love”<br>
Had been the very sum of my confession:<br>
O happy torment, when my torturer<br>
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!<br>
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Away, then! I am lock’d in one of them.<br>
If you do love me, you will find me out.<br>
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.<br>
Let music sound while he doth make his choice.<br>
Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end,<br>
Fading in music. That the comparison<br>
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<br>
And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win,<br>
And what is music then? Then music is<br>
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br>
To a new-crowned monarch. Such it is<br>
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br>
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear<br>
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br>
With no less presence, but with much more love<br>
Than young Alcides when he did redeem<br>
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br>
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice;<br>
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br>
With bleared visages come forth to view<br>
The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules!<br>
Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay<br>
I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> A song, whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to
himself.</p>

</p>
<p>ALL.<br>
     <i>Ding, dong, bell.</i>
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
So may the outward shows be least themselves.<br>
The world is still deceiv’d with ornament.<br>
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt<br>
But, being season’d with a gracious voice,<br>
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,<br>
What damned error but some sober brow<br>
Will bless it, and approve it with a text,<br>
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?<br>
There is no vice so simple but assumes<br>
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.<br>
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false<br>
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins<br>
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,<br>
Who inward search’d, have livers white as milk,<br>
And these assume but valour’s excrement<br>
To render them redoubted. Look on beauty,<br>
And you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight,<br>
Which therein works a miracle in nature,<br>
Making them lightest that wear most of it:<br>
So are those crisped snaky golden locks<br>
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind<br>
Upon supposed fairness, often known<br>
To be the dowry of a second head,<br>
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.<br>
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<br>
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf<br>
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,<br>
The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br>
To entrap the wisest. Therefore thou gaudy gold,<br>
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,<br>
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge<br>
’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,<br>
Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,<br>
Thy palenness moves me more than eloquence,<br>
And here choose I, joy be the consequence!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
[<i>Aside.</i>] How all the other passions fleet to air,<br>
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac’d despair,<br>
And shudd’ring fear, and green-ey’d jealousy.<br>
O love, be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,<br>
In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess!<br>
I feel too much thy blessing, make it less,<br>
For fear I surfeit.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
What find I here? [<i>Opening the leaden casket</i>.]<br>
Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god<br>
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?<br>
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,<br>
Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips,<br>
Parted with sugar breath, so sweet a bar<br>
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs<br>
The painter plays the spider, and hath woven<br>
A golden mesh t’entrap the hearts of men<br>
Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes!—<br>
How could he see to do them? Having made one,<br>
Methinks it should have power to steal both his<br>
And leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look how far<br>
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br>
In underprizing it, so far this shadow<br>
Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,<br>
The continent and summary of my fortune.
</p>
<p>
     <i>You that choose not by the view<br>
     Chance as fair and choose as true!<br>
     Since this fortune falls to you,<br>
     Be content and seek no new.<br>
     If you be well pleas’d with this,<br>
     And hold your fortune for your bliss,<br>
     Turn to where your lady is,<br>
     And claim her with a loving kiss.</i>
</p>
<p>A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave, [<i>Kissing her</i>.]<br>
I come by note to give and to receive.<br>
Like one of two contending in a prize<br>
That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,<br>
Hearing applause and universal shout,<br>
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br>
Whether those peals of praise be his or no,<br>
So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,<br>
As doubtful whether what I see be true,<br>
Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,<br>
Such as I am; though for myself alone<br>
I would not be ambitious in my wish<br>
To wish myself much better, yet for you<br>
I would be trebled twenty times myself,<br>
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times<br>
More rich,<br>
That only to stand high in your account,<br>
I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,<br>
Exceed account. But the full sum of me<br>
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,<br>
Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractis’d;<br>
Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br>
But she may learn; happier than this,<br>
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br>
Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit<br>
Commits itself to yours to be directed,<br>
As from her lord, her governor, her king.<br>
Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours<br>
Is now converted. But now I was the lord<br>
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<br>
Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,<br>
This house, these servants, and this same myself<br>
Are yours,—my lord’s. I give them with this ring,<br>
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,<br>
Let it presage the ruin of your love,<br>
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Madam, you have bereft me of all words,<br>
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,<br>
And there is such confusion in my powers<br>
As after some oration fairly spoke<br>
By a beloved prince, there doth appear<br>
Among the buzzing pleased multitude,<br>
Where every something being blent together,<br>
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy<br>
Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring<br>
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence.<br>
O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
My lord and lady, it is now our time,<br>
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,<br>
To cry, good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,<br>
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;<br>
For I am sure you can wish none from me.<br>
And when your honours mean to solemnize<br>
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you<br>
Even at that time I may be married too.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.<br>
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:<br>
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.<br>
You lov’d, I lov’d; for intermission<br>
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.<br>
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,<br>
And so did mine too, as the matter falls.<br>
For wooing here until I sweat again,<br>
And swearing till my very roof was dry<br>
With oaths of love, at last, (if promise last)<br>
I got a promise of this fair one here<br>
To have her love, provided that your fortune<br>
Achiev’d her mistress.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Is this true, Nerissa?
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.

Of any constant man. What, worse and worse?<br>
With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,<br>
And I must freely have the half of anything<br>
That this same paper brings you.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
O sweet Portia,<br>
Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words<br>
That ever blotted paper. Gentle lady,<br>
When I did first impart my love to you,<br>
I freely told you all the wealth I had<br>
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman.<br>
And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,<br>
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br>
How much I was a braggart. When I told you<br>
My state was nothing, I should then have told you<br>
That I was worse than nothing; for indeed<br>
I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,<br>
Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,<br>
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,<br>
The paper as the body of my friend,<br>
And every word in it a gaping wound<br>
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?<br>
Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?<br>
From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,<br>
From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,<br>
And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch<br>
Of merchant-marring rocks?
</p>
<p>SALERIO.<br>
Not one, my lord.<br>
Besides, it should appear, that if he had<br>
The present money to discharge the Jew,<br>
He would not take it. Never did I know<br>
A creature that did bear the shape of man<br>
So keen and greedy to confound a man.<br>
He plies the Duke at morning and at night,<br>
And doth impeach the freedom of the state<br>
If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,<br>
The Duke himself, and the magnificoes<br>
Of greatest port have all persuaded with him,<br>
But none can drive him from the envious plea<br>
Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
When I was with him, I have heard him swear<br>
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,<br>
That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh<br>
Than twenty times the value of the sum<br>
That he did owe him. And I know, my lord,<br>
If law, authority, and power deny not,<br>
It will go hard with poor Antonio.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,<br>
The best condition’d and unwearied spirit<br>
In doing courtesies, and one in whom<br>
The ancient Roman honour more appears<br>
Than any that draws breath in Italy.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
What sum owes he the Jew?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
For me three thousand ducats.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
What, no more?<br>
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond.<br>
Double six thousand, and then treble that,<br>
Before a friend of this description<br>
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.<br>
First go with me to church and call me wife,<br>
And then away to Venice to your friend.<br>
For never shall you lie by Portia’s side<br>
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold<br>
To pay the petty debt twenty times over.<br>
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.<br>
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime,<br>
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!<br>
For you shall hence upon your wedding day.<br>
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;<br>
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.<br>
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
<i>Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my
estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit, and since in paying it, it
is impossible I should live, all debts are clear’d between you and I, if
I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure. If your
love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.</i>
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Since I have your good leave to go away,<br>
I will make haste; but, till I come again,<br>
No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,<br>
Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.

<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy.<br>
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.<br>
Gaoler, look to him.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Hear me yet, good Shylock.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.<br>
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.<br>
Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,<br>
But since I am a dog, beware my fangs;<br>
The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,<br>
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond<br>
To come abroad with him at his request.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I pray thee hear me speak.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I’ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak.<br>
I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.<br>
I’ll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,<br>
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield<br>
To Christian intercessors. Follow not,<br>
I’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
It is the most impenetrable cur<br>
That ever kept with men.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Let him alone.<br>
I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.<br>
He seeks my life, his reason well I know:<br>
I oft deliver’d from his forfeitures<br>
Many that have at times made moan to me.<br>
Therefore he hates me.
</p>
<p>SALARINO.<br>
I am sure the Duke<br>
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
The Duke cannot deny the course of law,<br>
For the commodity that strangers have<br>
With us in Venice, if it be denied,<br>
’Twill much impeach the justice of the state,<br>
Since that the trade and profit of the city<br>
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go.<br>
These griefs and losses have so bated me<br>
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh<br>
Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.<br>
Well, gaoler, on, pray God Bassanio come<br>
To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo,
Jessica</span> and <span class="charname">Balthazar</span>.</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,<br>
You have a noble and a true conceit<br>
Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly<br>
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.<br>
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,<br>
How true a gentleman you send relief,<br>
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,<br>
I know you would be prouder of the work<br>
Than customary bounty can enforce you.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I never did repent for doing good,<br>
Nor shall not now; for in companions<br>
That do converse and waste the time together,<br>
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,<br>
There must be needs a like proportion<br>
Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;<br>
Which makes me think that this Antonio,<br>
Being the bosom lover of my lord,<br>
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,<br>
How little is the cost I have bestowed<br>
In purchasing the semblance of my soul<br>
From out the state of hellish cruelty!<br>
This comes too near the praising of myself;<br>
Therefore no more of it. Hear other things.<br>
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands<br>
The husbandry and manage of my house<br>
Until my lord’s return. For mine own part,<br>
I have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow<br>
To live in prayer and contemplation,<br>
Only attended by Nerissa here,<br>
Until her husband and my lord’s return.<br>
There is a monastery two miles off,<br>
And there we will abide. I do desire you<br>
Not to deny this imposition,<br>
The which my love and some necessity<br>
Now lays upon you.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Madam, with all my heart<br>
I shall obey you in all fair commands.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
My people do already know my mind,<br>
And will acknowledge you and Jessica<br>
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.<br>
So fare you well till we shall meet again.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas’d<br>
To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Jessica</span> and

<p>Now, Balthazar,<br>
As I have ever found thee honest-true,<br>
So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,<br>
And use thou all th’ endeavour of a man<br>
In speed to Padua, see thou render this<br>
Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario;<br>
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,<br>
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin’d speed<br>
Unto the traject, to the common ferry<br>
Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,<br>
But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.

</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>

That you yet know not of; we’ll see our husbands<br>
Before they think of us.

<p>NERISSA.<br>
Shall they see us?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit<br>
That they shall think we are accomplished<br>
With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,<br>
When we are both accoutered like young men,<br>
I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,<br>
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,<br>
And speak between the change of man and boy<br>
With a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps<br>
Into a manly stride; and speak of frays<br>
Like a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies<br>
How honourable ladies sought my love,<br>
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;<br>
I could not do withal. Then I’ll repent,<br>
And wish for all that, that I had not kill’d them.<br>
And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,<br>
That men shall swear I have discontinued school<br>
About a twelvemonth. I have within my mind<br>
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,<br>
Which I will practise.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Why, shall we turn to men?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Fie, what a question’s that,<br>
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!<br>
But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device<br>
When I am in my coach, which stays for us<br>
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,<br>
For we must measure twenty miles today.

<h3> <b>SCENE V. The same. A garden.</b></h3>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Launcelet</span> and
<span class="charname">Jessica</span>.</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the
children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you. I was always plain with you,
and so now I speak my agitation of the matter. Therefore be of good cheer, for
truly I think you are damn’d. There is but one hope in it that can do you
any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
And what hope is that, I pray thee?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the
Jew’s daughter.
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be
visited upon me.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Truly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I
shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother. Well, you are
gone both ways.
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
I shall be saved by my husband. He hath made me a Christian.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Truly the more to blame he, we were Christians enow before, e’en as many
as could well live one by another. This making of Christians will raise the
price of hogs; if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a
rasher on the coals for money.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Lorenzo</span>.</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
I’ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say. Here he comes.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelet, if you thus get my wife into
corners!
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo. Launcelet and I are out. He tells me flatly
there’s no mercy for me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s daughter;
and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews
to Christians you raise the price of pork.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of
the negro’s belly! The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an
honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will
shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but
parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
That is done, sir, they have all stomachs.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them prepare dinner.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Will you cover, then, sir?
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
Not so, sir, neither. I know my duty.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit
in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to
thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in
to dinner.
</p>
<p>LAUNCELET.<br>
For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the meat, sir, it shall be
covered; for your coming in to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
conceits shall govern.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

O dear discretion, how his words are suited!<br>
The fool hath planted in his memory<br>
An army of good words, and I do know<br>
A many fools that stand in better place,<br>
Garnish’d like him, that for a tricksy word<br>
Defy the matter. How cheer’st thou, Jessica?<br>
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,<br>
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
Past all expressing. It is very meet<br>
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,<br>
For having such a blessing in his lady,<br>
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth,<br>
And if on earth he do not merit it,<br>
In reason he should never come to heaven.<br>
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,<br>
And on the wager lay two earthly women,<br>
And Portia one, there must be something else<br>
Pawn’d with the other, for the poor rude world<br>
Hath not her fellow.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Even such a husband<br>
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

<p>JESSICA.<br>
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

I will anon. First let us go to dinner.
</p>
<p>JESSICA.<br>
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

No pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.<br>
Then howsome’er thou speak’st, ’mong other things<br>
I shall digest it.

</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Ready, so please your Grace.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
I am sorry for thee, thou art come to answer<br>
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,<br>
Uncapable of pity, void and empty<br>
From any dram of mercy.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I have heard<br>
Your Grace hath ta’en great pains to qualify<br>
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,<br>
And that no lawful means can carry me<br>
Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose<br>
My patience to his fury, and am arm’d<br>
To suffer with a quietness of spirit<br>
The very tyranny and rage of his.

Make room, and let him stand before our face.<br>
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,<br>
That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice<br>
To the last hour of act, and then, ’tis thought,<br>
Thou’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange<br>
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;<br>
And where thou now exacts the penalty,<br>
Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,<br>
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,<br>
But, touch’d with human gentleness and love,<br>
Forgive a moiety of the principal,<br>
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses<br>
That have of late so huddled on his back,<br>
Enow to press a royal merchant down,<br>
And pluck commiseration of his state<br>
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,<br>
From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train’d<br>
To offices of tender courtesy.<br>
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I have possess’d your Grace of what I purpose,<br>
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<br>
To have the due and forfeit of my bond.<br>
If you deny it, let the danger light<br>
Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!<br>
You’ll ask me why I rather choose to have<br>
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<br>
Three thousand ducats. I’ll not answer that,<br>
But say it is my humour. Is it answer’d?<br>
What if my house be troubled with a rat,<br>
And I be pleas’d to give ten thousand ducats<br>
To have it ban’d? What, are you answer’d yet?<br>
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;<br>
Some that are mad if they behold a cat;<br>
And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose,<br>
Cannot contain their urine; for affection<br>
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood<br>
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:<br>
As there is no firm reason to be render’d<br>
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig,<br>
Why he a harmless necessary cat,<br>
Why he a woollen bagpipe, but of force<br>
Must yield to such inevitable shame<br>
As to offend, himself being offended,<br>
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<br>
More than a lodg’d hate and a certain loathing<br>
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<br>
A losing suit against him. Are you answered?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,<br>
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>

Do all men kill the things they do not love?

What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I pray you, think you question with the Jew.<br>
You may as well go stand upon the beach<br>
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;<br>
You may as well use question with the wolf,<br>
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<br>
You may as well forbid the mountain pines<br>
To wag their high tops and to make no noise<br>
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;<br>
You may as well do anything most hard<br>
As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?—<br>
His Jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you,<br>
Make no moe offers, use no farther means,<br>
But with all brief and plain conveniency.<br>
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
If every ducat in six thousand ducats<br>
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,<br>
I would not draw them, I would have my bond.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?<br>
You have among you many a purchas’d slave,<br>
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,<br>
You use in abject and in slavish parts,<br>
Because you bought them. Shall I say to you<br>
“Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?<br>
Why sweat they under burdens? Let their beds<br>
Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates<br>
Be season’d with such viands”? You will answer<br>
“The slaves are ours.” So do I answer you:<br>
The pound of flesh which I demand of him<br>
Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.<br>
If you deny me, fie upon your law!<br>
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.<br>
I stand for judgment. Answer; shall I have it?

Go give him courteous conduct to this place.<br>
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Reads.</i>] <i>Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your
letter I am very sick, but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving
visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome. His name is Balthazar. I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the
merchant. We turn’d o’er many books together. He is furnished with
my opinion, which, bettered with his own learning (the greatness whereof I
cannot enough commend), comes with him at my importunity to fill up your
Grace’s request in my stead. I beseech you let his lack of years be no
impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation, for I never knew so young a
body with so old a head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial
shall better publish his commendation.</i>
</p>
<p>
You hear the learn’d Bellario what he writes,<br>
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Portia</span> dressed like a doctor of laws.</p>
<p>Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I did, my lord.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
You are welcome. Take your place.<br>
Are you acquainted with the difference<br>
That holds this present question in the court?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I am informed throughly of the cause.<br>
Which is the merchant here? And which the Jew?
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Is your name Shylock?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Shylock is my name.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Of a strange nature is the suit you follow,<br>
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<br>
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.<br>
[<i>To Antonio</i>.] You stand within his danger, do you not?
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Ay, so he says.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Do you confess the bond?
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I do.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Then must the Jew be merciful.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
The quality of mercy is not strain’d,<br>
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest,<br>
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.<br>
’Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes<br>
The throned monarch better than his crown.<br>
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br>
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br>
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br>
But mercy is above this sceptred sway,<br>
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br>
It is an attribute to God himself;<br>
And earthly power doth then show likest God’s<br>
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br>
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br>
That in the course of justice none of us<br>
Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,<br>
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br>
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br>
To mitigate the justice of thy plea,<br>
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br>
Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<br>
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Is he not able to discharge the money?
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Yes, here I tender it for him in the court,<br>
Yea, twice the sum, if that will not suffice,<br>
I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er<br>
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.<br>
If this will not suffice, it must appear<br>
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,<br>
Wrest once the law to your authority.<br>
To do a great right, do a little wrong,<br>
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
It must not be, there is no power in Venice<br>
Can alter a decree established;<br>
’Twill be recorded for a precedent,<br>
And many an error by the same example<br>
Will rush into the state. It cannot be.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!<br>
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I pray you let me look upon the bond.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.<br>
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<br>
No, not for Venice.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Why, this bond is forfeit,<br>
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<br>
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br>
Nearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful,<br>
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
When it is paid according to the tenour.<br>
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<br>
You know the law; your exposition<br>
Hath been most sound. I charge you by the law,<br>
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br>
Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear<br>
There is no power in the tongue of man<br>
To alter me. I stay here on my bond.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Most heartily I do beseech the court<br>
To give the judgment.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Why then, thus it is:<br>
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
O noble judge! O excellent young man!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
For the intent and purpose of the law<br>
Hath full relation to the penalty,<br>
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
’Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,<br>
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Therefore lay bare your bosom.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Ay, his breast<br>
So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?<br>
“Nearest his heart”: those are the very words.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
It is so. Are there balance here to weigh<br>
The flesh?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I have them ready.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,<br>
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Is it so nominated in the bond?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
It is not so express’d, but what of that?<br>
’Twere good you do so much for charity.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You, merchant, have you anything to say?
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
But little. I am arm’d and well prepar’d.<br>
Give me your hand, Bassanio. Fare you well,<br>
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you,<br>
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br>
Than is her custom: it is still her use<br>
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br>
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br>
An age of poverty, from which ling’ring penance<br>
Of such misery doth she cut me off.<br>
Commend me to your honourable wife,<br>
Tell her the process of Antonio’s end,<br>
Say how I lov’d you, speak me fair in death.<br>
And when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br>
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br>
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend<br>
And he repents not that he pays your debt.<br>
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br>
I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Antonio, I am married to a wife<br>
Which is as dear to me as life itself,<br>
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,<br>
Are not with me esteem’d above thy life.<br>
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all<br>
Here to this devil, to deliver you.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Your wife would give you little thanks for that<br>
If she were by to hear you make the offer.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
I have a wife who I protest I love.<br>
I would she were in heaven, so she could<br>
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
’Tis well you offer it behind her back,<br>
The wish would make else an unquiet house.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
These be the Christian husbands! I have a daughter—<br>
Would any of the stock of Barabbas<br>
Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!<br>
We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine,<br>
The court awards it and the law doth give it.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Most rightful judge!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.<br>
The law allows it and the court awards it.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Tarry a little, there is something else.<br>
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.<br>
The words expressly are “a pound of flesh”:<br>
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh,<br>
But in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br>
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<br>
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate<br>
Unto the state of Venice.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Is that the law?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Thyself shalt see the act.<br>
For, as thou urgest justice, be assur’d<br>
Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
O learned judge! Mark, Jew, a learned judge!
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I take this offer then. Pay the bond thrice<br>
And let the Christian go.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Here is the money.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Soft!<br>
The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! no haste!<br>
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.<br>
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more,<br>
But just a pound of flesh: if thou tak’st more<br>
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much<br>
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,<br>
Or the division of the twentieth part<br>
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn<br>
But in the estimation of a hair,<br>
Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!<br>
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Give me my principal, and let me go.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
I have it ready for thee. Here it is.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
He hath refus’d it in the open court,<br>
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!<br>
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Shall I not have barely my principal?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture<br>
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Why, then the devil give him good of it!<br>
I’ll stay no longer question.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Tarry, Jew.<br>
The law hath yet another hold on you.<br>
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,<br>
If it be proved against an alien<br>
That by direct or indirect attempts<br>
He seek the life of any citizen,<br>
The party ’gainst the which he doth contrive<br>
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half<br>
Comes to the privy coffer of the state,<br>
And the offender’s life lies in the mercy<br>
Of the Duke only, ’gainst all other voice.<br>
In which predicament I say thou stand’st;<br>
For it appears by manifest proceeding<br>
That indirectly, and directly too,<br>
Thou hast contrived against the very life<br>
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr’d<br>
The danger formerly by me rehears’d.<br>
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself,<br>
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<br>
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;<br>
Therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,<br>
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.<br>
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s;<br>
The other half comes to the general state,<br>
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.<br>
You take my house when you do take the prop<br>
That doth sustain my house; you take my life<br>
When you do take the means whereby I live.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake!
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
So please my lord the Duke and all the court<br>
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,<br>
I am content, so he will let me have<br>
The other half in use, to render it<br>
Upon his death unto the gentleman<br>
That lately stole his daughter.<br>
Two things provided more, that for this favour,<br>
He presently become a Christian;<br>
The other, that he do record a gift,<br>
Here in the court, of all he dies possess’d<br>
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
He shall do this, or else I do recant<br>
The pardon that I late pronounced here.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I am content.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
</p>
<p>SHYLOCK.<br>
I pray you give me leave to go from hence;<br>
I am not well; send the deed after me<br>
And I will sign it.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
Get thee gone, but do it.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
In christ’ning shalt thou have two god-fathers.<br>
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,<br>
To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Shylock</span>.</i>]</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon,<br>
I must away this night toward Padua,<br>
And it is meet I presently set forth.
</p>
<p>DUKE.<br>
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.<br>
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,<br>
For in my mind you are much bound to him.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Duke</span>

<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend<br>
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted<br>
Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof,<br>
Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew<br>
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
And stand indebted, over and above<br>
In love and service to you evermore.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
He is well paid that is well satisfied,<br>
And I delivering you, am satisfied,<br>
And therein do account myself well paid,<br>
My mind was never yet more mercenary.<br>
I pray you know me when we meet again,<br>
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.<br>
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute,<br>
Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,<br>
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.<br>
[<i>To Antonio</i>.] Give me your gloves, I’ll wear them for your sake.<br>
[<i>To Bassanio</i>.] And, for your love, I’ll take this ring from you.<br>
Do not draw back your hand; I’ll take no more,<br>
And you in love shall not deny me this.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
This ring, good sir? Alas, it is a trifle,<br>
I will not shame myself to give you this.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I will have nothing else but only this,<br>
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
There’s more depends on this than on the value.<br>
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,<br>
And find it out by proclamation,<br>
Only for this I pray you pardon me.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.<br>
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks<br>
You teach me how a beggar should be answer’d.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife,<br>
And when she put it on, she made me vow<br>
That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.<br>
And if your wife be not a mad-woman,<br>
And know how well I have deserv’d this ring,<br>
She would not hold out enemy for ever<br>
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

<p class="right"> [<i>Exeunt <span class="charname">Portia</span> and

Be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;<br>
Give him the ring, and bring him if thou canst<br>

Where Cressid lay that night.

Which is the hot condition of their blood,<br>
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>
Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>
Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze<br>
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br>
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,<br>
Since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,<br>
But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>
The man that hath no music in himself,<br>
Nor is not mov’d with concord of sweet sounds,<br>
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;<br>
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,<br>
And his affections dark as Erebus.<br>
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

<p>PORTIA.<br>
That light we see is burning in my hall.<br>
How far that little candle throws his beams!<br>
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
So doth the greater glory dim the less.<br>
A substitute shines brightly as a king<br>
Until a king be by, and then his state<br>
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook<br>
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
It is your music, madam, of the house.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.<br>
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark<br>
When neither is attended; and I think<br>
The nightingale, if she should sing by day<br>
When every goose is cackling, would be thought<br>
No better a musician than the wren.<br>
How many things by season season’d are<br>
To their right praise and true perfection!<br>
Peace! How the moon sleeps with Endymion,<br>
And would not be awak’d!
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>Music ceases.</i>]</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
That is the voice,<br>
Or I am much deceiv’d, of Portia.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,<br>
By the bad voice.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Dear lady, welcome home.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,<br>
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.<br>
Are they return’d?
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Madam, they are not yet;<br>
But there is come a messenger before<br>
To signify their coming.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Go in, Nerissa.<br>
Give order to my servants, that they take<br>
No note at all of our being absent hence,<br>
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
</p>
<p class="right"> [<i>A tucket sounds.</i>]</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet.<br>
We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
This night methinks is but the daylight sick,<br>
It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day<br>
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
</p>
<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Bassanio, Antonio,
Gratiano</span> and their Followers.</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
We should hold day with the Antipodes,<br>
If you would walk in absence of the sun.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Let me give light, but let me not be light,<br>
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,<br>
And never be Bassanio so for me.<br>
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.<br>
This is the man, this is Antonio,<br>
To whom I am so infinitely bound.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You should in all sense be much bound to him,<br>
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
No more than I am well acquitted of.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.<br>
It must appear in other ways than words,<br>
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
[<i>To Nerissa</i>.] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong,<br>
In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.<br>
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,<br>
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
A quarrel, ho, already! What’s the matter?
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring<br>
That she did give me, whose posy was<br>
For all the world like cutlers’ poetry<br>
Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
What talk you of the posy, or the value?<br>
You swore to me when I did give it you,<br>
That you would wear it till your hour of death,<br>
And that it should lie with you in your grave.<br>
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br>
You should have been respective and have kept it.<br>
Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,<br>
The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
He will, and if he live to be a man.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,<br>
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,<br>
No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,<br>
A prating boy that begg’d it as a fee,<br>
I could not for my heart deny it him.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
You were to blame,—I must be plain with you,—<br>
To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift,<br>
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,<br>
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<br>
I gave my love a ring, and made him swear<br>
Never to part with it, and here he stands.<br>
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it<br>
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth<br>
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<br>
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief,<br>
An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,<br>
And swear I lost the ring defending it.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away<br>
Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed<br>
Deserv’d it too. And then the boy, his clerk,<br>
That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine,<br>
And neither man nor master would take aught<br>
But the two rings.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
What ring gave you, my lord?<br>
Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
If I could add a lie unto a fault,<br>
I would deny it, but you see my finger<br>
Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Even so void is your false heart of truth.<br>
By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed<br>
Until I see the ring.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Nor I in yours<br>
Till I again see mine!
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Sweet Portia,<br>
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br>
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,<br>
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,<br>
And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br>
When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br>
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br>
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br>
Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br>
You would not then have parted with the ring.<br>
What man is there so much unreasonable,<br>
If you had pleas’d to have defended it<br>
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br>
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br>
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:<br>
I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<br>
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br>
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,<br>
And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,<br>
And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away,<br>
Even he that had held up the very life<br>
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br>
I was enforc’d to send it after him.<br>
I was beset with shame and courtesy.<br>
My honour would not let ingratitude<br>
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<br>
For by these blessed candles of the night,<br>
Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d<br>
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Let not that doctor e’er come near my house,<br>
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,<br>
And that which you did swear to keep for me,<br>
I will become as liberal as you,<br>
I’ll not deny him anything I have,<br>
No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.<br>
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.<br>
Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus,<br>
If you do not, if I be left alone,<br>
Now by mine honour which is yet mine own,<br>
I’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
And I his clerk. Therefore be well advis’d<br>
How you do leave me to mine own protection.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Well, do you so. Let not me take him then,<br>
For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Sir, grieve not you. You are welcome notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,<br>
And in the hearing of these many friends<br>
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<br>
Wherein I see myself—
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Mark you but that!<br>
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,<br>
In each eye one. Swear by your double self,<br>
And there’s an oath of credit.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Nay, but hear me.<br>
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear<br>
I never more will break an oath with thee.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I once did lend my body for his wealth,<br>
Which but for him that had your husband’s ring<br>
Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,<br>
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<br>
Will never more break faith advisedly.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,<br>
And bid him keep it better than the other.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio,<br>
For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,<br>
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,<br>
In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Why, this is like the mending of highways<br>
In summer, where the ways are fair enough.<br>
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz’d.<br>
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.<br>
It comes from Padua from Bellario.<br>
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,<br>
Nerissa there, her clerk. Lorenzo here<br>
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,<br>
And even but now return’d. I have not yet<br>
Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,<br>
And I have better news in store for you<br>
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon.<br>
There you shall find three of your argosies<br>
Are richly come to harbour suddenly.<br>
You shall not know by what strange accident<br>
I chanced on this letter.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
I am dumb.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,<br>
Unless he live until he be a man.
</p>
<p>BASSANIO.<br>
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.<br>
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
</p>
<p>ANTONIO.<br>
Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;<br>
For here I read for certain that my ships<br>
Are safely come to road.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
How now, Lorenzo!<br>
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
</p>
<p>NERISSA.<br>
Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.<br>
There do I give to you and Jessica,<br>
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,<br>
After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.
</p>
<p>LORENZO.<br>
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way<br>
Of starved people.
</p>
<p>PORTIA.<br>
It is almost morning,<br>
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br>
Of these events at full. Let us go in,<br>
And charge us there upon inter’gatories,<br>
And we will answer all things faithfully.
</p>
<p>GRATIANO.<br>
Let it be so. The first inter’gatory<br>
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,<br>
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,<br>
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.<br>
But were the day come, I should wish it dark<br>
Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.<br>
Well, while I live, I’ll fear no other thing<br>
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
